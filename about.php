			<p>
			&#10077 Ismail Mehmood Designs was established in 1993 as a locally registered firm of Consulting Architects with Ismail Mehmood Patel as Principal.
			This Firm is located in Area 2 on Plot No. 2/132, Bombay Road, Lilongwe.</p> <p>
			IMD Architects has been functioning as a successful firm of architects for over twenty years in Lilongwe - Malawi.  
			The firm is comprised of the principal architect, two graduate architects; as well as two architectural technicians, secretarial and administration staff.</p> <p>
			IM Designs has improved its capacity through computerizing its operations and boasts seven AutoCAD workstations and two A1 colour Plotters.   </p> <p>
			In most projects, IM Designs are the lead consultant, and have provided the Architectural as well as the Project Management Services.
			The key architectural members of staff at IM Designs are diverse and dynamic both in view of their cultural and ethnic backgrounds, as well as their architectural training.  
			This diversity is a microcosm of the social environment in Malawi, and serves to ensure that each design carried out responds to the diverse nature of our society, environment and context.</p> <p> 
			IM Designs has a strong financial foundation and is respected in Malawi by both colleagues and clients alike.   
			The IM Designs team has a passion for architecture and can often be found delighting over the smallest of architectural details, 
			and feels in many ways that it shares the social responsibility for the development of both the city of Lilongwe and Malawi as a whole. </p> <p>
			As a team, the staff members have resolved numerous design problems.  
			The intention has been to translate the Client’s requirements into a design solution, which blends with the surrounding, 
			rendering it both of an approachable human scale, as well as having a unity with its surrounding architectural fabric, while avoiding architectural ubiquity. </p> <p>
			Since its establishment, IM Designs has completed a variety of architectural works including single and multi-storey office buildings, 
			a library building prototype, churches, mosques, hospital extensions, a children’s ward, an outpatient department, medical Centre,
			single and multi storey private houses and a four-star hotel with a shopping Centre among many more. &#10078</p> <p>
